OBIA segmentation data (data_set_2.zip) has been designed as six segmentations and one sample file.
data_set_2.zip contains related shapefiles for synthetic data.
The dataset includes GIS vector files as follows:
Sample's files: 
samples.shp, samples.dbf, samples.sbx, samples.shx 
Segmentations' files: 
segmentation_1.shp, segmentation_1.dbf, segmentation_1.sbx, segmentation_1.shx
segmentation_2.shp, segmentation_2.dbf, segmentation_2.sbx, segmentation_2.shx
segmentation_3.shp, segmentation_3.dbf, segmentation_3.sbx, segmentation_3.shx
segmentation_4.shp, segmentation_4.dbf, segmentation_4.sbx, segmentation_4.shx
segmentation_5.shp, segmentation_5.dbf, segmentation_5.sbx, segmentation_5.shx
segmentation_6.shp, segmentation_6.dbf, segmentation_6.sbx, segmentation_6.shx

You should unzip the data_set_2.zip file to your working directory before using them.
Please remember to define the directory path with datasets in the toolbox's first tab.
Then apply the second tab for import. This may take some time. Please note that only one import will be enough. 
In the third tab, accuracy metrics can be run.
