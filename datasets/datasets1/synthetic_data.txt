Synthetic data has been designed as one segmentation and sample file.
You should unzip the dataset files to your working directory before using them.
You may choose either data_set_1_1.zip or data_set_1_2.zip dataset to test the toolbox PySAAT with the synthetic data.

data_set_1_1.zip (need import):
  data_set_1_1.zip contains related shapefiles for synthetic data.
  The dataset includes files as follows:
    samples.shp, samples.dbf, samples.sbx, samples.shx 
    segmentation_1.shp, segmentation_1.dbf, segmentation_1.sbx, segmentation_1.shx 
  Please do not forget to define the directory having datasets in the first tab of the toolbox.
  Then apply the second tab for import. Only once import will be enough. 
  

data_set_1_2.zip (no need import):
  data_set_1_2.zip contains toolbox files already imported for synthetic data.
  The dataset includes files as follows:
    sample.pkl, samples.pdf 
    segmentation1/
      intersect.pkl, segment.pkl, process_time.txt 
  This data should be processed directly without import in the third tab. Please do not forget to define the directory having datasets in the first tab of the toolbox. 
Then skip to the third tab for the accuracy analysis.
