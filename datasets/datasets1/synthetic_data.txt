Synthetic data has been designed as one segmentation and one sample files.
data_set_1.zip contains related shapefiles for synthetic data.
The dataset includes GIS vector files as follows:
sample: samples.shp, samples.dbf, samples.sbx, samples.shx 
segmentation: segmentation_1.shp, segmentation_1.dbf, segmentation_1.sbx, segmentation_1.shx 

You should unzip the data_set_1_1.zip file to your working directory before using them.
Please do not forget to define the directory path having datasets in the first tab of the toolbox.
Then apply the second tab for import. This may take some time. Please note that only once import will be enough.
In the third tab, accuracy metrics can be run.
